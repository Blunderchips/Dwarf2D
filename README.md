###Welcome to Dwarf2D!
Dwarf2D is an easy to use set of utilites wrapped around <a href='http://lwjgl.org/' title='lwjgl.org'>LWJGL</a> (Lightweight Java Game Library), <a href='http://www.opengl.org/' title='openGL.org'>OpenGL</a> (Open Graphics Library)  and <a href='http://OpenAl.org/' title='openAl.org'>OpenAL</a> (Open Audio Library) design to make Java 2D game development easier and ultimately better for all, Dwarf2D is totally free, and can be used in anything from friendly open-source hobby projects, to evil, closed-source commercial ones. With a Slick design you are certain to LÃ–VE it!

Dwarf2D is currently being used in game development, but it is still considered an experimental framework based on an experimental concept. Please use in your projects at your own risk.

**Watch/star to follow along with progress!**
